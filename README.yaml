# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an AWS CloudFront CDN with an S3 origin.

# How to use this project
usage: |-

  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  module "cdn" {
    source = "cloudposse/cloudfront-s3-cdn/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version     = "x.x.x"
    namespace         = "eg"
    stage             = "prod"
    name              = "app"
    aliases           = ["assets.cloudposse.com"]
    dns_alias_enabled = true
    parent_zone_name  = "cloudposse.com"
  }
  ```

  ### Using an S3 Static Website Origin

  When variable `website_enabled` is set to `true`, the S3 origin is configured
  as a static website. The S3 static website has the advantage of redirecting
  URL `subdir/` to `subdir/index.html` without requiring a
  [Lambda@Edge function to perform the redirection](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/implementing-default-directory-indexes-in-amazon-s3-backed-amazon-cloudfront-origins-using-lambdaedge/).
  The S3 static website responds only to CloudFront, preventing direct access to
  S3.

  In addition to setting `website_enabled=true`, you must also:

  * Specify at least one `aliases`, like `["example.com"]` or
    `["example.com", "www.example.com"]`
  * Specify an ACM certificate

  ### Generating an ACM Certificate

  Use the AWS CLI to [request new ACM certifiates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs-acm-request.html) (requires email validation)
  ```
  aws acm request-certificate --domain-name example.com --subject-alternative-names a.example.com b.example.com *.c.example.com
  ```

  __NOTE__:

  Although AWS Certificate Manager is supported in many AWS regions, to use an SSL certificate with CloudFront, it should be requested only in US East (N. Virginia) region.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-requirements.html
  > If you want to require HTTPS between viewers and CloudFront, you must change the AWS region to US East (N. Virginia) in the AWS Certificate Manager console before you request or import a certificate.

  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-regions.html
  > To use an ACM Certificate with Amazon CloudFront, you must request or import the certificate in the US East (N. Virginia) region. ACM Certificates in this region that are associated with a CloudFront distribution are distributed to all the geographic locations configured for that distribution.

  This is a fundamental requirement of CloudFront, and you will need to request the certificate in `us-east-1` region.

  If there are warnings around the outputs when destroying using this module.
  Then you can use this method for supressing the superfluous errors.
  `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS=1 terraform destroy`
